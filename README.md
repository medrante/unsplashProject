# unsplashProject

This project is a starter project to learn the Ionic React framework. It uses the Unsplash API and the filesystem Capacitor Plugin. Follow the steps below to set it up and get it running.

## Tools needed (per the Ionic React Page)

1. Node.js - for interacting with the Ionic ecosystem. [Download the LTS version here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Code editor! (I use VSCode).
3. Command-line interface/terminal (CLI):
   ... Windows users: either built-in cmd line or Powershell in admin mode!
   ... Mac/Linux users, virtually any terminal will work.
4. Ionic Tools: (more details here) [https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app]
   ... \* `npm install -g @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res`

## To run the app:

1. `npm install` - this installs all the packages used in the app
   ... if you get an error, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file.
2. `ionic serve` - make sure your browser is open; a tab will automatically open!
